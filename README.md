# Guess My Number Game üéØ

## Description

The "Guess My Number" game is a simple and engaging game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is correct or incorrect. The player has three lives (‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è), and each incorrect guess results in losing one life. The objective is to guess the correct number before running out of lives. The game features an intuitive interface and instant feedback to guide the player towards the correct number.

## Features

- **User Input**: The player enters their guesses using an input field.
- **Feedback Messages**: Immediate feedback is provided to indicate if the guess is correct or incorrect.
- **Life Span Mechanism**: Players start with three lives. Each incorrect guess deducts one life.
